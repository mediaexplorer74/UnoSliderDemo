# Contribute!
There's still a TON of things missing from this proof-of-concept (MVP) and areas of improvement 
which I just haven't had the time to get to yet.
- UI Improvements (for GTK, for example, or for each one of supported mutli-platforms)))
- New features (toasts, etc..))
- Additional Language Packages
- Media Transferring Support: screenshots, etc. (for the brave)

## Solution Layout
I shere this demo because of it's good for your own R.E. :)
There are no DOCs which explains all architecture and etc. yet... this is just my UNO beginning! =) 

With best wishes,
